Functionality of the code can be shown by running the provided assembly code. A pre-compiled hexfile will be provided, but you can compile it yourself as well. In the assembly-file, I have written the work register and file register values after each step, so please open the assembly file to see them. You can compare these values to the output of QuestaSim. 

To run the test:

'''
cd simulations
use advms_17.1
vsim -do tb_top.do
'''
